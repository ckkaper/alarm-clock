1. Complete the CRUD operations
    - Complete POST
    - Complete PUT  
        - corner cases: 
            - Update alarm when in same timezone
            - Update alarm when in a different timezone than the timezone the alart was set

# Brainstorming
    Client data:
        - What the date format will be
        ?? 2023-01-30T04:04:47.668Z
        ?? timezoneOffset to the form of "+2:00"
        - how the server will read these values and generate the result 
        ?? convert the date to unix epoch
        ?? use date.getTime(); to do that
        ?? and if that time is in the range of 30 secs between now and the next 30 minutes generate the alarm
        - in case of timezone update, how the server will calculate and store the value of the new updated timezones
        + convert the store time in epoch, 
        + in order to calculate the new alartm time:
            + get the utc epoch, by substracting or adding the original offset
            + apply the new offset to that epoch 
            + calculate the alarmTimeStamp and store it
    Server data: 
        - How the server will store the date
